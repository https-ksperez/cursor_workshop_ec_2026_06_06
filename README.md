# MarketLab

MarketLab is a fake-money prediction market app for the Cursor workshop.

## Setup

Clone the repo, open a terminal in the project folder, and run the setup script
for your operating system.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
bash ./scripts/unix-setup.sh
```

### Windows

Open PowerShell and run this command first:

```powershell
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows-setup.ps1
```

If Windows says `pwsh` is not recognized, run this command instead:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows-setup.ps1
```

After the script finishes, open a new terminal window before running the
remaining commands. The setup script adds mise activation to your shell so the
tools pinned in `mise.toml` are available through normal `task ...` commands.

If a new PowerShell window still reports that `task` is not recognized, your
execution policy is likely blocking the PowerShell profile that activates mise.
Allow it once for your user, then open a new window:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```

## Run

```bash
task dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Useful Commands

```bash
task verify
task --list
```

## Tool Troubleshooting

If `task` is missing, the current shell probably has not loaded mise yet. Open
a new terminal, or activate mise in the current shell:

```powershell
(& mise activate pwsh) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
task dev
```

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
eval "$(mise activate bash)"
task dev
```

Use `mise activate zsh` instead if your shell is zsh.
